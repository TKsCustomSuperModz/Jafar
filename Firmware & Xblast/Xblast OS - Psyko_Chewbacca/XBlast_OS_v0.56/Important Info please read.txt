Important information concerning XBlast OS v0.56 update.

Your XBlast device (XBlast Lite or Aladdin XBlast) will need
to already be at least at version v0.50 in order to apply v0.56. 
Trying to apply v0.56 update when running a version XBlast OS 
older than v0.50 will result in it identifying the update image 
as invalid.

Starting with v0.55, XBlast OS integrates a recovery method
that will reset all Xblast OS settings to their defaults on
launch. To trigger the recovery, you must hold Right trigger,
Left trigger, X button and Y button all at the same time on 
console boot or on XBE launch. As always, to actually persist
the default settings, you must either boot a BIOS bank or
select "Power OFF" or "Reboot" menu items in XBlast OS. 
Simply powering off the console via the power button will
revert to your previous settings on next boot.

Also starting with v0.55. XBlast OS integrates a recovery
mechanism in the unlikely event of an interrupted OS update.
If such event was to occur, XBlast OS would default to booting
the 512KB BIOS bank to allow you to retry updating the OS
via the XBE version of XBlast OS. That's why, starting with
v0.55, it is strongly suggested to always ensure your Xbox
can fully boot from the 512KB BIOS bank before attempting
a future OS update.
